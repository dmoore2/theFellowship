<h1>Hello Class of 2016!</h1><br><br>

<p>We are a a fellowship of involved and dedicated juniors with very
different interests and backgrounds. We six have united for one 
ultimate mission: to improve the Stanford experience of our class.
As a brief introduction, here are the key issues that we all are 
passionate about and have decided focus on in our agenda. <br><br> </p> 

<h2><b>1) Increasing the number of students that can go abroad. </b><br></h2> 
<p>
Current programs aren't as big as the student populace 
that is qualified and interested in participating, and many majors 
involve stringent requirements that make it hard to go abroad 
during any academic year. We are interested in working with Bing 
Overseas and the Haas Center to increase the number of students 
that can attend current overseas studies programs, as well as 
introduce a well-established and Stanford-associated program for 
working abroad during the summer. <br><br> </p>

<h2><b> 2) Consolidating mental health awareness and support. </b><br></h2>
<p>We will work to form a committee composed of members 
of all mental health groups. This will help the junior class work 
through the pressures of approaching graduation by providing a 
place for students to go for support and health counseling. <br><br></p> 

<h2><b> 3) Establishing a career mentorship network on campus. </b><br></h2>
<p>Our slate has a passion for creating mentorship and education and one 
of our focuses will be to connect juniors with professionals in their 
fields of interest.  
We are well aware that for many of us, our major 
doesn't constitute our desired career, and would like to start a 
series of mixers and academic talks to help students explore and 
discover their interests. Speakers can range from tech to modern 
art to public policy- whatever our class thinks we need most. <br> <br></p>

<h2><b>4) Make the arts more accessible to students. We want art to 
play a more central role on campus. </b><br></h2>

<p>We plan to address this issue by increasing the number of openings in classes such as studio art 
classes - so students can explore passions outside their majors. 
We are planning to work with Cantor to hold more student-oriented 
events to encourage participation in and appreciation for the arts on 
campus. If there is a significant amount of student interest, a junior 
class musical could also be fun. <br><br></p>

<h2><b>5) Pushing campus cultural diversity programming. </b><br></h2>

<p>While Stanford is home to one of the most diverse student populations 
in the United States, we have yet to exploit that in cultural 
programming. A junior class culture show (that is free admission) 
and class events with plenty of ethnic foods are only a couple ideas 
we have for accomplishing this. <br><br> </p>

<h2><b>6) And, last but not least... planning fun social events for 
juniors! </b></h2>

<p>What kind of parties you ask? Think... Wolf of Wall Street...
Most importantly, we are here for you Class of 2016. Really, that 
is why we are doing this. We want to win this so much because we 
truly believe that our slate has the dedication, the enthusiasm, and 
the spirit to make Junior year an amazing experience. We have 
been planning this campaign for a long time and are willing to go 
the extra mile for each of you, so please, contact us. We want to 
get to know you! Please ask us questions about our agenda and let 
us know if you think that something is missing on it. Our goal is to 
make Junior year as enriching, diverse, stirring, and memorable 
experience as possible. <br> <br> </p>

<p><b> THERE MAY come a day </b> when the spirit of Stanford 
students fails, when no one cries "beat Cal" anymore. But it is not this day! A day, when the booming heartbeat of Stanford innovation ceases forever, when the 
lonely sound of a saxophone no longer springs from White Plaza, but it is not this day! 
when there is no more brilliant sunshine to light our futures, and 
when these young, hopeful California days, that we let so easily 
slip away, leave us entirely behind. When for all we cherish now 
we have only one, vanishingly long, sweet memory... <b> but it is not 

THIS day!!! <br> <br><br>

Today is yours. </b><br><br></p>
